# Discord-Bot-Base
This is the base of a Discord Bot in Node.js

First you must create an application in Discord, and thus be able to create the bot and obtain its Token, you can do this from the Discord Developers section:

https://discord.com/developers/

Then you will need to modify the [config.json](https://github.com/AcoDev/Discord-Bot-Base/blob/master/config.json)

---

To start with the bot, run the following command in the terminal:

`npm install`

This will install the necessary dependencies.

To start the bot so you can start to see how it works and you can learn to develop it on your own, use one of the following commands:

`node index.js`

or

`npm run dev`
